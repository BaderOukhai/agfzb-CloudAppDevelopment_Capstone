    <p>

    Established in 2003, our family-owned enterprise, 
    renowned for its exceptional customer-centric approach, 
    transitioned from its roots in trade to the bustling world of retail. 
    Spanning four generations, our dedicated team comprises over 30 skilled 
    professionals, ensuring a familial touch in every interaction.
    Pride in our work has earned us a loyal customer base, with more than half 
    of our clientele returning for our services. Our commitment to excellence is
     reflected in our recognition as a 'Highly rated' dealer on Auto Trader and 
     a 'Top rated' dealer on Car Gurus.
    Our expansive facility showcases an impressive collection of over 180 
    vehicles, encompassing a diverse array of types, models, and styles. 
    Complementing our sales area, we boast a state-of-the-art workshop, a 
    professional valet bay, and a specialized 'smart' repair center.
    The collective expertise of our staff is unparalleled, amassing over 130 
    years of experience in the motor industry. This wealth of knowledge is a 
    testament to our commitment to quality and service. Many of our team members
     have been with us for the long haul, a rarity in the motor trade. This 
     means the salesperson who guides you through your purchase is likely to be 
     there for you in the future. Our workshop personnel, integral to our 
     operation, have been with us since our inception.
    We gained notable recognition in 2009 when our vehicles featured in the film
     "The Fast and The Furious." Our inventory, priced between £3,000 and £150,000, ensures a wide selection for every customer. If you're looking for something specific, we're adept at sourcing your ideal vehicle.
    We're also experts in finance solutions, catering to various credit ratings 
    and working with leading companies and specialist brokers. Our warranties, 
    valid for up to four years and approved by Trading Standards, offer 
    nationwide repair center access, ensuring peace of mind with your purchase.
